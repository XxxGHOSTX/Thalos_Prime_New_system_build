STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
------------------
Your application now has a professional Windows deployment structure:

ROOT FOLDER (ThalosApp):
  - LAUNCH.bat ← Double-click this to start!
  - LAUNCH_GUI.bat ← Or this for GUI mode
  - LAUNCH_ADVANCED_GUI.bat ← Or this for advanced GUI
  - main.py, app.py, etc. ← Entry points for advanced users
  - README.md ← Start here for documentation
  - WINDOWS_DEPLOYMENT.md ← Detailed setup guide

SUBFOLDERS:
  - thalos_prime/ ← Your core AI system (all modules intact)
  - thalos_sbi_standalone/ ← Standalone SBI system
  - docs/ ← All documentation (47 files organized here)
  - scripts/ ← Utility scripts (21 files organized here)
  - tests/ ← Test files
  - data/ ← Runtime data (created automatically)
